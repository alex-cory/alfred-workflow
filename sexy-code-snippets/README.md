#Sexy Code Snippets with gist

This workflow will allow you to search through your gists with Alfred.  The key though, is to add code snippets as gists, add #snippet in the name, and then begin the name of the snippet with the language that it is using.

Ex: php autoloader #snippet

By doing this, it will only bring in your gists that are snippets, you can find them via the language they use, and then everyone can see your snippets on GitHub!  It's like a repository full of your snippets.

The most useful part about this is, once you find the snippet you're looking for, simply hit enter and it will copy the snippet to your clipboard as well as paste it into the editor/application/etc that you are currently using.  Hope everyone likes it!
